  description: " This Verilog module defines a synchronous 32-bit counter, where the count increments on each rising edge of the clock input (clk). Additionally, it features an asynchronous reset input (rst), which, when activated, sets the counter output (out) to zero regardless of the clock signal."
  language: "Verilog"  # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz: 50000000  # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)
  tiles: "1x1" # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM. Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2
